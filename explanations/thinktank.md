This prompt outlines a structured simulation of a multi-agent debate system, but it’s important to be clear: it isn’t a true agentic swarm. It’s a single model emulating multiple perspectives through roleplay. While it borrows the language of agent-based systems—terms like “Skeptics,” “Believers,” and “Neutral Analysts”—these aren’t independent agents. They’re just conceptual lenses used within a single inference pass.

The structure is solid as a scaffold for critical analysis. There are three teams, each with clearly defined roles that approach the topic from distinct philosophical, scientific, and psychological angles. The process moves through three phases: internal team debate, cross-team response, and neutral synthesis. The final output is a single report summarizing both sides and offering a balanced conclusion.

It’s a useful exercise, especially for mapping out the dimensions of a topic. But let’s not confuse it with true agentic architecture. There’s no autonomy, memory, or persistence of conflict between roles. It’s all one instance, executing a performance of deliberation.

For anyone serious about building actual agentic systems, this is a great place to start—but the next step is to implement those roles as independent processes capable of disagreement, feedback, and evolution. As an exercise, here’s a basic pseudocode version of what a real agentic swarm might look like—where each agent has its own strategy, memory, and interaction loop, and where synthesis happens only after multiple perspectives are generated and reconciled.

### Real Agentic Swarm (Pseudocode)

Here's a basic pseudocode structure for an *actual* agentic swarm, where each role is an independent process or AI agent:

```python
# Define agent roles
class Agent:
    def __init__(self, name, strategy):
        self.name = name
        self.strategy = strategy
        self.memory = []

    def debate(self, topic, opposing_args=None):
        return self.strategy(topic, opposing_args)

# Instantiate agents with strategies
skeptics = [Agent("Empirical Critic", empirical_strategy), ...]
believers = [Agent("Metaphysical Advocate", metaphysical_strategy), ...]
neutrals = [Agent("Scientist", science_review_strategy), ...]

# Phase 1: Internal Team Debates
skeptic_reports = [agent.debate(topic) for agent in skeptics]
believer_reports = [agent.debate(topic) for agent in believers]

# Phase 2: Cross Debate
skeptic_responses = [agent.debate(topic, believer_reports) for agent in skeptics]
believer_responses = [agent.debate(topic, skeptic_reports) for agent in believers]

# Phase 3: Neutral Analysis
final_reviews = [agent.debate((skeptic_responses, believer_responses)) for agent in neutrals]

# Final Report
final_report = synthesize(final_reviews)
print(final_report)
```

You could actually implement this using:

* Independent functions (or microservices)
* Separate GPT API calls with role prompts
* A controller to manage flow and responses

### For the Reader: Try This

* Take the current prompt and **rewrite it using real concurrent agents or separate prompts**.
* Use `openai.ChatCompletion.create()` for each role with system-level instruction.
* Store arguments/responses per agent.
* Use a neutral agent to synthesize results programmatically.

That’s when you start building actual **agentic systems**.
