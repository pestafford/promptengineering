## We're creating an 'agentic swarm' here. This breaks the LLM into separate personas, with different expertises and viewpoints. 
## Creating agents like this has many benefits:
## 1. Each agent is a complete 'instance' of the LLM. You now have as many LLMs as you have agents.
## 2. Each agent is focused on a particular part of the training data. This narrows each agent to a specific subset, much like creating a custom LLM each time.
## 3. The agents talk to each other and present their own viewpoints. This identifies the strengths and flaws of each viewpoint more efficiently. See: Socratic Dialogue
## 4. The Foreman brings everything together to reach consensus and provide the final report.

### Notes: You can think of this as creating your own team of experts with a manager on top to give you a corporate report. The Foreman gives you the opinions of the team
### as they have reached consensus. 

### Enhancements:
### Ask for the complete transcript of the debate for more insights.
### Direct the agents to argue more adversarily for more robust arguments
### Change the honesty of the agents to be more brutal and not worry about being kind.
### Change the number of rounds for a stronger analysis
