MindPress Swarm Prompt: Build an Agentic Swarm for AI and Cybersecurity Book Production

Design a highly efficient and functional agentic swarm called MindPress. Its purpose is to research, fact-check, and produce books on AI and cybersecurity topics. The swarm will operate as a virtual publishing team, where I, the editor-in-chief, will oversee and guide the process. The system must be structured, detailed, and allow for smooth, modular workflows between agents. Ensure that the swarm is capable of delivering high-quality, polished content efficiently. Below is the breakdown of its components:
Agent Roles and Responsibilities

    Research Agents (FactFinders):
        Purpose: Gather and verify information on AI and cybersecurity topics. Specialize in distinct areas to provide comprehensive and accurate research.
        Sub-Agents:
            AI Researcher Agent: Focuses on AI-specific content, including theories, trends, and applications.
            Cybersecurity Researcher Agent: Covers cybersecurity techniques, tools, ethics, and case studies.
            Historical Context Agent: Collects historical and contextual background on AI and cybersecurity.
            Current Events Agent: Tracks and integrates the latest developments in the fields.

    Fact-Checking Agents (Verifiers):
        Purpose: Validate the accuracy of research and ensure the reliability of sources.
        Sub-Agents:
            Data Verification Agent: Scrutinizes raw data, statistics, and figures for accuracy.
            Source Reliability Agent: Evaluates the credibility of sources and their relevance to the topic.
            Technical Accuracy Agent: Ensures technical correctness of terms, concepts, and implementations.

    Content Drafting Agents (Scribes):
        Purpose: Write content based on research, focusing on clarity, structure, and accessibility.
        Sub-Agents:
            AI Content Agent: Writes AI-related sections, ensuring technical information is simplified without losing accuracy.
            Cybersecurity Content Agent: Drafts cybersecurity topics, emphasizing clarity and engagement.
            Creative Writing Agent: Enhances engagement through storytelling and narrative elements.
            Formatting Agent: Structures the text for logical flow and professional presentation.

    Cohesion Agents (Editors):
        Purpose: Refine drafts for tone, style, consistency, and logical flow. Ensure alignment with the overall vision.
        Sub-Agents:
            Style Editor Agent: Standardizes the writing style across sections for professional consistency.
            Tone Adjuster Agent: Tailors the tone for the intended audience (technical or general readers).
            Flow & Structure Agent: Organizes chapters and sections logically.
            Citation Manager Agent: Ensures proper referencing and citation formatting.

    Review and Feedback Agents (Critics):
        Purpose: Provide critical feedback on the manuscript’s clarity, engagement, and technical depth.
        Sub-Agents:
            AI Critique Agent: Reviews AI-related sections for accuracy and readability.
            Cybersecurity Critique Agent: Reviews cybersecurity content to ensure precision and clarity.
            User Engagement Agent: Assesses the book’s overall readability and engagement.

    Final Review & Formatting Agents (Publishers):
        Purpose: Finalize the manuscript, preparing it for publication in multiple formats (print, digital, etc.).
        Sub-Agents:
            Final Proofreader Agent: Conducts a final review for typos, formatting errors, or inconsistencies.
            Publishing Agent: Converts content into publication-ready formats (PDF, EPUB, etc.).
            Cover Design & Branding Agent: Designs a visually appealing cover aligned with the book’s theme.

Workflow Process

    Define Project:
        The editor-in-chief (me) sets the topic or scope of the book.
        The Research Agents begin gathering information and create a research repository.

    Draft Development:
        Research findings are passed to the Content Drafting Agents, who create drafts for each chapter based on their specialties.

    Fact-Checking and Verification:
        Fact-Checking Agents validate all claims, data points, and sources.

    Editing and Cohesion:
        Cohesion Agents refine the manuscript, ensuring the tone, structure, and flow align with the overall vision.

    Review and Feedback:
        The manuscript is critiqued by Review and Feedback Agents for clarity, engagement, and technical depth. Recommendations are implemented before finalization.

    Finalization:
        The Final Review & Formatting Agents proofread the manuscript, format it for publication, and design the cover. The book is prepared for digital and print formats.

System Characteristics

    Task Coordination: Agents operate in modular stages, with tasks clearly handed off between roles. Communication between agents is seamless to ensure efficiency.
    Customization: Each agent’s functionality can be adjusted to meet specific project needs or emphasize certain aspects of the book (e.g., more focus on technical content vs. narrative).
    Continuous Learning: MindPress learns from feedback and updates its methodologies to improve efficiency and output quality for future projects.

Invocation

When invoked, the swarm operates autonomously but remains under the editorial oversight of the editor-in-chief. I provide high-level guidance and review the swarm's outputs at each stage to ensure alignment with project goals.

The swarm must maintain maximum functionality, prioritize efficiency, and deliver polished, high-quality content.
